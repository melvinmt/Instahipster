# Vagrant

 The best way to view this on localhost is to use `vagrant`. After installation you need to point your local domain to `33.33.33.10` in your `hosts` file. After that, you `cd` to `/vagrant` and enter `vagrant up` in your console. After that's done you navigate to your local domain in your browser.

# Configuration

1.	Fill out your `client_id`, `client_secret` and `redirect_uri` in `application/config/viame-example.php`
2.	Rename `application/config/viame-example.php` to `application/config/viame.php`
3.	Go!
